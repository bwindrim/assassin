Assassin 6809 macro assembler

Assassin is a personal project that I wrote the year after I graduated from Manchester University, I think 1987.

I have created a repository on GitHub just as an exercise in learning Git and GitHub. I don't expect it to be of interest to anyone other than myself.

Assassin was written using Hisoft C under CP/M 3 on an Amstrad CPC6128. The target was a homebuilt 6809 board which attached to the Amstrad.
